		<p>	The eye of the nape is the centre of cerebellum of the brain. When the semen alias Kundalini (embryo to the forehead) passes through the backbone it has to pass this eye of the nape by rubbing against it. This friction will cause heat to be generated at that spot. This heat is called the lunar cycle. </p>
